Purpose\n  1. This Manual Part recommends design criteria and functional/operating \nguidelines for terminal blocks used in the wiring of signal apparatus which \nare installed in weather protected enclosures, having circuits rated at 600 \nvolts or less and utilize solid and/or stranded copper wire sizes No. 24 \nAWG through No. 2 AWG. See Manual Part 1.4.1 (Identical Items \n'Boilerplate' for all Manual Parts), Section A. \n B. General\n  1. The terminal block assembly described by these recommendations \nprovides an alternate method for terminating or connecting copper wires \nand cables. \n 2. Terminal blocks and installed accessories (i.e. jumpers, test sockets, etc.) \nused where electrical shock hazards exist, as defined in Manual Part \n11.1.1 (Recommended Functional/Operating Guidelines for Electrical \nSafety), shall be 'touchproof' or insulated in design. \n 3. The metallic clamping mechanism of the terminal block shall surround the \nwire on all sides to prevent wire strands from splaying outside the \nclamping area. \n 4. When mounting rail is used, the terminal block or terminal block assembly \nshould be suitable for and be mounted on DIN 35 type rail. \n 5. When screw-type terminal blocks are used, the screws shall be tightened \nto the manufacturer's recommended torque value. \n 6. Each clamping mechanism of the terminal block shall be limited to the \nconnection of one wire or conductor. \n 7. The terminal block should be properly sized to allow the wire insulation to \nfit freely into the terminal block housing and designed to prevent the wire \ninsulation from exerting pressure on the adjacent terminal block. \n    © 2007 AREMA"

Manufacturer Documentation\n  1. The manufacturer should provide all documentation necessary to allow the \npurchaser to identify and select the proper terminal block or terminal block \nassembly based on the purchaser's particular requirements, along with \napplication notes and suggestions, installation techniques, proper set up \nand testing routines, maintenance procedures requirements, and repair \nand replacement instructions. \n 2. Manufacturer should provide material specifications and engineering type \ndrawings of applicable terminal blocks and accessories. \n 3. Operational instructions should also be available and, in the case of \nscrew-type terminal blocks, the instructions/decals should list the screw \ntorque requirements in units of inch-pounds. \n D. Mechanical Requirements\n  1. The terminal block should be of sufficient size and design to \naccommodate a standard straight-bladed screwdriver with a minimum \nblade width of 1/8 in. \n 2. The terminal block should be designed to accept solid and/or stranded \ncopper conductors without requiring special wire preparation, such as \ncrimps, ferrules or tinning, to assure the mechanical and electrical \nconnection integrity without damage to conductors. \n 3. If it is necessary to remove a stranded wire frequently from the terminal \nblock or connector, the use of a ferrule or cable-end-sleeve may be \ndesirable. The design of the terminal block should not prevent or interfere \nwith the use of this wire preparation. Due consideration should be given to \nthe increase in conductor size when using a ferrule. \n 4. The current carrying portions of the terminal block shall be copper or \ncopper alloy for good conductivity and hardness without the risk of stress \ncracking and also to keep the coefficient of expansion similar to that of the \ncopper conductor. \n 5. The contact surface of current carrying parts shall be coated or plated to \nprevent corrosion. Coating/plating should be of tin, lead, nickel, or tin/lead \nalloy. \n 6. The wire clamping mechanism shall be inherently corrosion resistant or \nplated to resist corrosion. \n © 2007 AREMA"

When mounting rail is used, terminal blocks should be able to be removed \nfrom the mounting rail independent from adjacent terminal block. \n 11. When the terminal block assembly is installed on the mounting rail, the \nterminal blocks, with the exception of grounding terminal blocks, should be \npermitted to slide laterally to the vacant portion of the mounting rail \nproviding that a sufficient and diverted force is applied. Vibration or \ntemperature changes shall not cause lateral movement. \n 12. Positive mechanical locking mechanisms (end stops) shall be used to \nprevent the terminal block assembly from sliding on the mounting rail, \nwhen mounting rail is used. \n 13. The physical strength of the insulating housing and conductor clamping \nmechanism should, when installed, exceed the force exerted by the \ntightening torque when connecting the largest wire size for which it was \ndesigned. \n 14.

Purpose\n  This Manual Part recommends design criteria and functional/operating guidelines \nfor incandescent electric lamps generally required for wayside signals and \nhighway-rail grade crossing warning devices used in railroad signal service. See \nManual Part 1.4.1 (Identical Items 'Boilerplate' for all Manual Parts), Section A. \n B. General\n  1. Large lamps, designated as lamps, are regularly fitted with other than \nminiature bases. These lamps are used in railroad signal applications and \nshall be referred to as lamps hereafter in this Manual Part. \n 2. Lamps should conform to Appendix A. \n 3. Electrical units referred to in this Manual Part are the current International \nUnits. \n 4. Units of luminous intensity shall be the International Candle as maintained \nby the National Institute of Standards & Technology, Gaithersburg, MD \n20899. \n 5. The basis of photometric measure for all lamps may be either the total flux \nexpressed in lumens, or the equivalent mean spherical candlepower, \nwhich is the average candlepower of the lamp in all directions in space \nand equals the total luminous flux of the lamp divided by 12.57. \n 6. The rating of lamps is expressed by volts together with either amperes, \nwatts, candlepower or lumens. \n 7. The life of the lamp is the rated average laboratory life in hours. In two \nfilament lamps the burnout of either filament is considered as the end of \nlife. The average life or equivalent truncated average life is obtained by \nthe summation of the lives of individual lamps divided by the number of \nlamps.  Those lamps still operating at the termination of the test are \ntreated as having lives of 125% of rated life. \n C. Bulb and Stem\n  Bulb shall be uniform in size and shape, clear, clean and free from flaws and \nblemishes detrimental to service. \n© 2007 AREMA"
